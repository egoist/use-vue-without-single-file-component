# use-vue-without-single-file-component

Here's the example showing how to use Vue 2 in React style.

Instead of using `.vue` single file component this demo simply uses `.js` file to form a component. (CSS modules/Babel JSX)

In this way, we'd better use jsx instead of template string, since it's not `.vue` so we won't have template string to be syntax highlighted.

To run this example:

```bash
$ npm run watch

$ npm run serve
# open browser
```
